Liveness is the availability of a finalizing chain. If the chain stops finalizing or users are not able to access it easily, those are liveness failures. Extremely high cost of access could also be considered a liveness failure. Safety refers to how difficult it is to attack the chain - i.e. finalize conflicting checkpoints.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09437.pdf\"\n  }, \"Read more in the Casper paper\")));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","tableOfContents":{"items":[{"url":"#what-is-proof-of-stake-what-is-proof-of-stake","title":"What is proof-of-stake {#what-is-proof-of-stake}"},{"url":"#how-does-proof-of-stake-compare-to-proof-of-work-comparison-to-proof-of-work","title":"How does proof-of-stake compare to proof-of-work? {#comparison-to-proof-of-work}"},{"url":"#is-proof-of-stake-energy-efficient-is-pos-energy-efficient","title":"Is proof-of-stake energy efficient? {#is-pos-energy-efficient}"},{"url":"#is-proof-of-stake-secure-is-pos-secure","title":"Is proof-of-stake secure? {#is-pos-secure}"},{"url":"#does-proof-of-stake-make-ethereum-cheaper-does-pos-make-ethereum-cheaper","title":"Does proof-of-stake make Ethereum cheaper? {#does-pos-make-ethereum-cheaper}"},{"url":"#what-are-nodes-clients-and-validators-what-are-nodes-clients-and-validators","title":"What are nodes, clients and validators? {#what-are-nodes-clients-and-validators}"},{"url":"#is-proof-of-stake-a-new-idea-is-pos-new","title":"Is proof-of-stake a new idea? {#is-pos-new}"},{"url":"#what-is-special-about-ethereums-proof-of-stake-why-is-ethereum-pos-special","title":"What is special about Ethereum's proof-of-stake? {#why-is-ethereum-pos-special}"},{"url":"#what-is-slashing-what-is-slashing","title":"What is slashing? {#what-is-slashing}"},{"url":"#why-do-validators-need-32-eth-why-32-eth","title":"Why do validators need 32 ETH? {#why-32-eth}"},{"url":"#how-are-validators-selected-how-are-validators-selected","title":"How are validators selected? {#how-are-validators-selected}"},{"url":"#what-is-stake-grinding-what-is-stake-grinding","title":"What is stake grinding? {#what-is-stake-grinding}"},{"url":"#what-is-social-slashing-what-is-social-slashing","title":"What is social slashing? {#what-is-social-slashing}"},{"url":"#will-i-get-slashed-will-i-get-slashed","title":"Will I get slashed? {#will-i-get-slashed}"},{"url":"#what-is-the-nothing-at-stake-problem-what-is-nothing-at-stake-problem","title":"What is the nothing-at-stake problem? {#what-is-nothing-at-stake-problem}"},{"url":"#what-is-a-fork-choice-algorithm-what-is-a-fork-choice-algorithm","title":"What is a fork choice algorithm? {#what-is-a-fork-choice-algorithm}"},{"url":"#what-is-finality-in-proof-of-stake-what-is-finality","title":"What is finality in proof-of-stake? {#what-is-finality}"},{"url":"#what-is-weak-subjectivity-what-is-weak-subjectivity","title":"What is \"weak subjectivity\"? {#what-is-weak-subjectivity}"},{"url":"#is-proof-of-stake-censorship-resistant-is-pos-censorship-resistant","title":"Is proof-of-stake censorship resistant? {#is-pos-censorship-resistant}"},{"url":"#can-ethereums-proof-of-stake-system-be-51-attacked-pos-51-attack","title":"Can Ethereum's proof-of-stake system be 51% attacked? {#pos-51-attack}"},{"url":"#what-is-social-coordination-and-why-is-it-needed-what-is-social-coordination","title":"What is social coordination, and why is it needed? {#what-is-social-coordination}"},{"url":"#do-the-rich-get-richer-in-proof-of-stake-do-rich-get-richer","title":"Do the rich get richer in proof-of-stake? {#do-rich-get-richer}"},{"url":"#is-proof-of-stake-more-centralized-than-proof-of-work-is-pos-decentralized","title":"Is proof-of-stake more centralized than proof-of-work? {#is-pos-decentralized}"},{"url":"#why-can-i-only-stake-eth-why-can-i-only-stake-eth","title":"Why can I only stake ETH? {#why-can-i-only-stake-eth}"},{"url":"#is-ethereum-the-only-proof-of-stake-blockchain-is-ethereum-the-only-pos-blockchain","title":"Is Ethereum the only proof-of-stake blockchain? {#is-ethereum-the-only-pos-blockchain}"},{"url":"#what-is-the-merge-what-is-the-merge","title":"What is The Merge? {#what-is-the-merge}"},{"url":"#what-are-liveness-and-safety-what-are-liveness-and-safety","title":"What are liveness and safety? {#what-are-liveness-and-safety}"}]}}},"pageContext":{"language":"ca","slug":"/ca/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/faqs/","ignoreTranslationBanner":false,"isLegal":false,"isOutdated":false,"isContentEnglish":true,"relativePath":"src/content/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/faqs/index.md","locale":"ca","hrefLang":"ca","originalPath":"/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/faqs/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","3003422828","3280999885","446219633"],"slicesMap":{}}
